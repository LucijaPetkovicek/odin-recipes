            Homemade butter is always tastier, healthier and has better texture than storebought. If you make it with locally farmed sour cream it' even better!
            I also recommend mixing the butter with chopped herbs (you can use fresh but if you want to store it for longer periods, use dehydrated), peppers, fruits, honey... You can try any combination!
